ðŸ“Œ Derivative Calculator

This project is a versatile Python-based Derivative Calculator that supports both symbolic and numerical differentiation of mathematical functions. It is designed to be beginner-friendly yet powerful, making it useful for students, educators, and developers.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Symbolic Differentiation: Solve derivatives step by step using symbolic computation.

Numerical Differentiation: Approximate derivatives at given points.

Menu-Driven Interface: Simple and interactive navigation for users.

Expression Handling: Supports a wide range of mathematical expressions.

Error Handling: Ensures valid input for smooth execution.

ðŸ”¹ Technology Stack

Language: Python

Libraries Used: sympy, math (and others if applicable)

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

Run the program.

Choose between symbolic or numerical differentiation.

Enter the mathematical expression and, if required, the value of the variable.

Get the result instantly.

ðŸ”¹ Example
Function: f(x) = x^3 + 2x
Mode: Symbolic Differentiation
Result: f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2

ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
